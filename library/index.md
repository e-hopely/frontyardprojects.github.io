1.  BOOKS ARE FOR USE.
2.  EVERY READER HIS [OR HER] BOOK.
3.  EVERY BOOK ITS READER.
4.  SAVE THE TIME OF THE USER.
5.  THE LIBRARY IS A GROWING ORGANISM.
(*S. R. Ranganathan, 1931*)

Frontyard has a non-lending library. It is founded on the decommissioned Australia Council Research Library and is now a growing collection of material related to, and generated by, the Australian arts community. 

The collection needs to be catalogued. If you are interested in helping, please get in touch.

**Note:** *The Australia Councilâ€™s library was decommissioned in November 2014 due to very low usage levels over a sustained period. While the collection was small the Council has endeavoured to have key materials remain publicly available through donations to other libraries. Items that were unique to the Australia Council collection have been offered to the National Library of Australia in Canberra.*

We would like to thank the Australia Council for the Arts and Rachel Smithies and Amanda Coombes in particular for their generous donation of the collection to \*\*Frontyard\*\*.
