### A postcapitalist reading group at \*\*frontyard\*\*

**The 10th of each month from 6-8pm in the Frontyard Library.**

Frontyard will be hosting regular reading groups around contested notions of postcapitalism. This group is open to anyone who is interested in how we can think and act collectively outside and beyond the current capitalist system, and in understanding and fleshing out current thoughts around postcapitalism. There is no predetermined reading list â€” as yet - and we are hoping that at the first reading group on the **10th of March** we can all bring along texts that could be interesting to read. We will read excerpts to each other, and discuss what texts might be interesting to read and discuss in more detail, but also more importantly what we each would like to get out of the reading group.

If you have some potential reading suggestions - please join the email group and share them with us all.

**Some potential readings:**

### Email discussion

If emails are too frequent and annoying we recommend turning on digest mode, so that the days emails are sent in a single package.

We have decided to use freelist as the discussion platform rather than google groups, facebook or any other such services because freelists explicitly does not commodify our data and personal information. It makes sense to choose a service that aligns ethically with the subject we are discussing rather than continuing to feed the hegemonic powers with our immaterial digital labour.
