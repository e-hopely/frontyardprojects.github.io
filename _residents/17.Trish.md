Whilst at Frontyard, Patricia will ponder the possible futures of a dance pirate radio station. 
She will spend two weeks having cups of tea and hot toddys with various friends and interested strangers, researching options. These include developing a group performance with friends and having a series of conversations/rants/postulations/chats "on air" about dance and choreography.
