Julian Day is a sound artist developing a new body of work exploring Jane Bennett's concept of 'vibrant matter', the idea that the natural world around us has as much agency and direction as that of the human. Following his recent work 'White Noise' at NEW16 (ACCA, Melbourne) Julian is experimenting with silent yet violently vibrating sounds below human hearing and the impact these might have on various 'inert' membranes.
