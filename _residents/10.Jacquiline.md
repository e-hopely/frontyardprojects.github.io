Jacquelene Drinkall will build on her research paper ‘Neuromodulations of Extro-Scientific Telepathy’ forthcoming in the book “Psychopathologies of Cognitive Capitalism, Part Three” (edited by Warren Neidich, Archive Books, Berlin), and address the question of how telepathy and speculation are relevant to art and cognitive capitalism in a new mini-manifesto.

She will also be researching and developing a cut-up, collaged and instructional ‘martial arts’ yoga poster designed to develop attentive mental/physical space and techniques of estrangement from capitalist algorithms, using yoga postures set in relation to datagraphics. Anyone can contribute suggestions to the poster and manifesto. Email: [jacquelenedrinkall@gmail.com](mailto:jacquelenedrinkall@gmail.com)
