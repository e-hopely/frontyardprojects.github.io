Connie and Ian will be working on a speculative zine project looking at radical re-purposing strategies for cookie-cutter apartment blocks. In the same way that post-industrial spaces were gentrified in standard ways to become restaurants, warehouse lofts, and retail spaces in the nineties and noughties, Anthes and Milliss will be 'reverse-purposing' boring residential developments to prepare for the inevitable glut of poorly built, unimaginative living spaces. This project will take the form of a series of speculative conversations between physical Connie and digital Ian alongside the production of a Survival Guide for a future-useful Sydney.
