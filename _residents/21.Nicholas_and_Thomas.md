Nick and Thomas are co-Founders of The Accountability Institute

The Accountability Institute Aims to foster collaborations between art, science, technology, and economics, bringing these fields into conversation to create a new language - a language of accountability. 

The Accountability Institute Aims to provide an online space transforming our experience through education, research and transdisciplinary collaboration – to create intersectional perspectives.

Associate Professor Nick McGuigan (Monash University) and Thomas Kern (Macquarie University) joined forces in 2015 to establish ‘The Accountability Institute’ - a thought tank for the futuring of accounting and accounting education that works to create intersectional perspectives between art, science, technology and economics.

During their Frontyard residency they will be exploring the edges of professional accounting and business services through an interaction with art. Through the use of creative design principles and a focus on the theme of accountability they aim to explore the social constructivist nature of accounting, attempting to vision the future of accounting and the accountant.
