*Why Am I So Contemporary?*

During this residency, I will ponder the question: Why am I so contemporary? What distinguishes me from the moderns? Why, when the stakes were so low, did I invest in innovation, in *poetry*, an art form that can be described as having low market value but high cultural worth? In thinking through these questions between my birthday (Aug 29) and Sept 11, I will consult the rich resources in the room, examine my surroundings. What makes stale fresh? What turns “new goose” into “neoteric anseriformes”? I'm only twenty-nine years old, and I've already reached utopia in my work. If I can do it, anybody can.
