OAF is opening an Office of Ideas @Frontyard - a public space for public data work and civic technology. Anyone can join them to hack, share ideas and skills, all while they prepare for the COMMUNITY HACKFEST on 23 April.

OAF's vision is to transform democracy in Australia. They currently do this through half a dozen major web-based projects. These websites aim at finding better ways of making government, the public sector and political information freely and easily available for the benefit of all Australians. This transparency aims to encourage and inform people about how they can make a difference.
