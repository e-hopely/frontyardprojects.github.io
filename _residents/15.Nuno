Nuno and Isabel will enact a dialogue about the present. One of us is present (physically located in the space of the residency and visibly working on it) and the other is absent (elsewhere; working to earn money). At the moment of writing, we are together, exchanging considerations about personal compost, its degree of intimacy and its possible exchange value. A large piece of sandstone we uncovered in the garden yesterday will be photographed and re-buried. These are some of the entry points for a conversation of varying degrees of intimacy that we wish to uncover and share with Frontyard and its guests.
