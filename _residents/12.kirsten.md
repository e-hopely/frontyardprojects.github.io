Kirsten will work on developing a vocabulary and a set of practices that distinguishes making place, as multimodal emergence and correspondence, from placemaking, which is an instrument and industry in support of neo-liberal state and corporate agendas. This could culminate in a workshop or round table for interested participants to discuss these separate processes.
