  about: |
    Aesthetic evaluation is an increasingly widespread part of life in wealthy post-industrial societies, from televised talent shows, to the rating systems of Airbnb and Tripadvisor. In his residency, Tom Lee of theaustralianugilness.wordpress blog and Instagram account will look at the relationship between the urban landscape and aesthetics in a networked culture, where the more interesting thing about taste isn't the distinction between the beautiful and the ugly, but the uncertainty surrounding such judgements and the increasingly mixed, dynamic and radically subjective relationship people have with what gives them pleasure and purpose.
